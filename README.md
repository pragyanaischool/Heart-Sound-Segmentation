# Heart-Sound-Segmentation
In this project, first task was to locate the sounds particular to a heart within the audio data and then segment the audio files on the basis of the two sounds. I have used supervised approach to solve this segmentation problem.This segmentation is very helpful in detection of the Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs).
Audio samples have been provided in the Atraining_normal folder. The segmented file is also provided to train the model. Convolutional neural network has been trained to predict the two sounds S1 and S2.
